LWAPI also known as Sonic2013, is a reverse engineering attempt at creating an API library for Sonic Lost World (codename: Sonic2013) for easily creating mods that interact with the game universe.

- Send and recieve actor messages
- Register object resource information
- Interact with game services
- Creating simple game services (untested)

## Can't Do:
- Load resources
- Register set objects
- World interaction (collision)
